# Statistical_Modelling_Inference_2
Clustering seminar, where both hard and soft clustering algorithms have been implemented: from gap statistics and elbow methods to Mclust implementation, while also displaying clustering trees. R has been the chosen programming language.  

Moreover, theoretical proofs and exercises on the Bayesian EM algorithm are attached.
